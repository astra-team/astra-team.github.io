**Abstract**  
The objective of this thesis is to plan the motion of an autonomous vehicle so that it can navigate and interact with other moving obstacles without collision in an urban environment. This involves taking into account constraints that may be specific to the vehicle (dynamic, energetic, linked to perception or forecasting systems), relating to the safety and comfort of users or to the environment close to the vehicle. These last depend on the topology of the road, driving rules and other moving actors in the neigborhood of the ego-vehicle. In the context of this thesis, we focused on: (i) the limited or partial perception of the environment close to the vehicle and in particular the presence of static or mobile obstacles hiding part of its neighborhood ; (ii) uncertainty about the prediction of the motion of other agents; (iii) maneuvers to be carried out in urban scenarios where the lanes can be congested with plenty of other static or moving obstacles; (iv) and the respect of the road signs. All these issues have been addressed through geometric approaches by adapting in different ways the principle of path-velocity decomposition introduced by Kant and Zucker (1986). The CARLA simulator has been adapted to validate the proposed approaches on different scenarios reproducing typical situations of interaction with other vehicles in an urban environment, such as, for example, crossing a crossroads with reduced visibility, overtaking a slow or stopped vehicle in its lane, driving in a section of road regulated by traffic lights, etc.
