      title: Vision and 3D Perception for Scene Understanding
      # subtitle: A subtitle
      text: |
        We study 2D vision and 3D perception for robust scene understanding. Our research focuses on relaxing the use of abundant data and supervision, stepping towards weak-/un-supervised vision algorithms, while providing models that are more interpretable. We primarily address autonomous driving but our research expands to a variety of indoor and outdoor applications.

      title: Localization & Mapping
      # subtitle: A subtitle
      text: Vehicle localization and environmental mapping are pillars of the perception task for an autonomous vehicle. While vehicle localization ensures the global positioning of the vehicle in its environment and local positioning with regard to the road and to the close road features, environment mapping contributes in building a useful internal representation that is exploited by the decision system. We address here some of the remaining locks about integrity, safety, data size and costs points.

      title: Decision making, motion Planning \& vehicle Control
      # subtitle: A subtitle
      text: Decision-making, maneuver and motion planning, and vehicle control are vital components because they bridge the perception subsystem of the environment and the bottom-level control subsystem. In this axis, we address these issues covering various strategies of designing the decision-making, trajectory planning, and tracking control, as well as shared driving of the human-automation to adapt to different levels of the automated driving system accounting with the driver profile.

      title: Large scale modeling and deployment of mobility systems in Smart Cities
      # subtitle: A subtitle
      text: This axis is concerned with the use of vehicles, rather with their conception. The focus here is to model systems comprising a large number of vehicles, often seen as random entities. Our methodology explores the links between large random systems and statistical physics -- a powerful approach, both for macroscopic and microscopic analysis. The general setting is mathematical modelling of large systems, without any a priori restriction like networks, random graphs, etc.
