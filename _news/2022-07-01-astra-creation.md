title: Creation of the Astra team
---

As a result of decades of separate research on intelligent transportation at Inria and in Valeo, the joint Inria-Valeo research team “Astra” is created with a joint objective to research on Automated and Safe TRAnsportation systems.

The new Astra research team is the result of several years of fruitful collaborationsbetween Valeo and Inria that led to the transfer of several successful innovations. In order to address simultaneously the relevant challenges, Valeo group and Inria decided to create ASTRA, a joint research team capable of addressing these scientific and technological challenges.

This new astra research team is in the line of prior Inria teams such as Imara (20xx-20xx led by Michel Parent), RITS (2012-2022 led by Michel Parent). Astra is the direct evolution of RITS Inria team which worked on designing models, algorithms, and novel architectures for intelligent transportation systems.

The new Astra team is leaded by Fawzi Nashashi (Inria) and Benazouz Bradai (Valeo). The research is articulated around 4 axes. More info
